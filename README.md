# About This Project
It's a Project given to me by the University.

<p>This project is about an Information System in which we record traffic accident data and analyze this data based on user preferences.
Written in Laravel, it has a lot of potential as i keep going it will get better and better.
As of Dec 2023 it's still an ongoing project, i update slowly due to work schedule.</p>

In order to Install
1. Fork/Clone/Download this repo (your preference).
2. Install PostgreSQL.
3. Follow the general sequence you would to install an existing laravel project on a new machine.


## Have fun playing around and remember that this project is at it's start, still unfinished and will have a lot more to offer when it's done.
